# SortingHatQuiz
Let the Sorting Hat pick your House!

This is a Java program that uses a for loop to run through a Harry Potter themed quiz.  A method was created to accept user input as well as track their responses to ultimatly add them and find the most common answer.  In case of a tie, a tie breaker question has been added based on which two answers are tied.  In the end, the user's house is displayed!
